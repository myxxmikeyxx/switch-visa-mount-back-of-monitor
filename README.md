The links to the files I remixed are [here](https://github.com/myxxmikeyxx/switch-visa-mount-back-of-monitor/blob/master/orginal/links%20.txt).

TinkerCAD is where the STL's where changed and you can see the history.
The notch that is cut out of the plate is it does not block the Audio in on the monitor.
I am planning on making the cable organizer attach somewhere to the holder.
